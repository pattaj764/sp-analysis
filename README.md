# sp-analysis
basic python script deriving insights from changing stock values

## basic functions
sp-analysis is a straight-forward python program developed as part of foundations of business programming.

As of feb-2025, this program contains extremely limited functionality. i hope to build it out to be more useful to the user in the near future as i begin my own exploration of the stock market.

## using sp-analysis
The program works by prompting the user for the absolute pathname of a static csv containing daily stock values from the s&p 500.

Begin by downloading the requisite files sp-analysis.py and the sample data I have provided (spy.csv)

To run the program, open a terminal, change to the directory of sp-analysis and run the script:

python3 sp-analysis.py

You will be prompted for the absolute pathname of the csv file. Executing the program answers simple prompts given to us by our professor.

Enjoy!
